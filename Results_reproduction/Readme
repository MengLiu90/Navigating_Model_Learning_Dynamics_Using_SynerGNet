```results_GEN_weak_regularization``` contains the information of the model performance when the regularization strength is weak, 
where the test loss increases and the predictive accuracy also increases.

```results_GEN_weak_regularization``` contains the information of the model performance when the regularization strength is enhanced,
where the overfitting trend is effectively eliminated.
